This is an IR Proximity Sensor Based Counter Circuit with 7 segment dislplay.
Mainly the purpose of this project is " To  design a system that counts factory products using an IR proximity sensor and displays the count on a 7-segment display.
For this project we used total 9 component and here are: LM358 IC, CD4026 IC, IR Receiver led, IR Led, Jumped Wires, 9V battery, 10kilo ohm preset potentiometer, 7-segment display, and Resistors: 330 ohm, 1kilo ohm, 10kilo ohm.

After implementation we have the complete project; The picture of complete project and a short clip of working process are also uploaded. Working process short video fille name is " working.mp4"

After that we have to write the project report in IEEE format.That also uploaded
